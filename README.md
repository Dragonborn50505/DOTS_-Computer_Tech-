Using localPosition is better to use than world space counterparts. Maybe could have used transform.localPosition instead of "LocalTransform.Position".
Ude Time.deltaTime in all frame by frame calulations

It is better to use "[SerializeField] private" rather the "public" but I unfortunately did not use it on the public gameobjects
